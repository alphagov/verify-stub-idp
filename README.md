## Note about the history of this repository

Commits made up to and including
83a97b5157c25f3dad56bc0293ef5e78d8a2b2a4 in this repository may have
had their history altered as part of the open sourcing process.  That
means the apparent changesets are incomplete due to removed files, and
thus the commit messages could not be representative of the changes
made at the time.

Merge commits were not preserved as part of the open sourcing process.

## Running

Use [verify-local-startup](https://github.com/alphagov/verify-local-startup) to start the app.  It will also create all the appropriate config/PKI to run the app locally.

## Configuring the app

A yaml file containing IDPs needs to be created and the file location set as  `stubIdpsYmlFileLocation` in the app yml config file

The format is as follows:

```yaml
stubIdps:
  - friendlyId: stub-idp-one-for-rp1
    displayName: Stub IDP One
    assetId: stub-idp-one
    sendKeyInfo: true
    idpUserCredentials:
        - user: userName
          password: <password hash>
```

The friendlyId can be used to enable multiple IDPs but using the same displayName and assetId e.g. for different on-boarding relying parties.

Header images for IDPs should be placed into `ida-stub-idp/src/main/resources/assets/images/providers/` and are referenced as `assetId` e.g. stub-idp-one.png is referenced as `stub-idp-one`

Persistence can be enabled in the yml config file by modifying `infinispan.persistenceToFileEnabled`

##Â Deploying to PaaS

Before Stub IDP can be deployed to PaaS, you need to provision two services in the space you are deploying to. Make sure you are logged into PaaS Cloudfoundry and then run `./create_paas_services.sh` as follows:

```
CF_SPACE=target-space LOGIT_ENDPOINT=endpoint ./create_paas_services.sh
```

The Logit endpoint can be obtained by logging into logit.io (via GApps) and copying the Verify Stubs stack ID.

## Connecting to a hub/using as an IDP

You need to use the entityId `http://stub_idp.acme.org/{friendlyId}/SSO/POST` or as the template configured in the main config file, with the shared key/cert configured in the main config file (`stub-idp.yml`)

The SSO URI for that IDP will be `http://localhost:50140/{friendlyId}/SAML2/SSO` or equivalent.

You need to set the hub (or service) entityId that messages will be received from/sent back to, as well as where the hub/service metadata can be received from -> see the `hubEntityId` and `metadata` configuration blocks.

## Test Users

Test users can be uploaded to the IDPs [docs](https://alphagov.github.io/rp-onboarding-tech-docs/pages/env/envEndToEndTests.html#createtestusers)

Basic auth for the `/{friendlyId}/users` endpoint is enabled by default and can be configured using `basicAuthEnabledForUserResource`
